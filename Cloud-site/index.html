      <h2>My Skills</h2>


      <h3>How I Started: Java</h3>
      <p>I started learning to code years ago to make an app that I could use to project
        pool drill layouts onto my pool table using an overhead projector. At the time no
        software existed for that purpose. Then I began creating games using Java for fun in
        in my free time.

      <h3>Front End</h3>

      <p class="front-end">Over time, my interest in creating websites
        grew and I began adding to my knowledge of the front end aspect of web development.
        I began to delve into HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also started to learn how to
        implement the psychology of consumers I was learning while getting my MBA into my websites.

      <h3>Back End</h3>

      <p>After I decided I wanted to make programming my career I continued to hone my skills
        in Java and began learning how the back end of web development worked. I started studying
        PHP, SQL, and Python to better understand how my websites interacted with databases and APIs.
